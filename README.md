The project "Health&Me" helps it's users to access certain medical facilities from home. 

1. There is a feauture for Emergency cases. 2 different emergency buttons have been allocated for these cases. First one, for a child birth emergency case. Second, for an accident emergency case. 
   These buttons show up a form on clicking, which asks just for 3 information pieces and 1 checkbox. Then, a web page shows up on clicking "Submit" button, which is present with tips for the respective emergency.

2. The customers can book an appointment for themselves for different purposes(listed separately for fixing the appointment accurately with the right doctor). It asks you details from age group to preffered date, all for your safety. 
3. The customers can order the medicines and machines online. Well, ordering medicines would require the details of the doctor and the photograph of the prescription, all for the verification.

We've given Home , About and Contact us pages in our website. These contain query form, address(ample text) and social media handle places.

Also, on submitting each of the forms(except for the two emergency forms), website lands you to the confirmation message webpage.
